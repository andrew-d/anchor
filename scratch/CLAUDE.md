The 'scratch' directory contains temporary files, logs, and any other data that is generated by a LLM. All contents of this directory (other than this CLAUDE.md file and the gitignore file) are ignored and will not be committed.

Treat any file in this directory as temporary and ephemeral. Code in this directory may be temporary, for tests, or debugging; DON'T take stylistic or quality guidelines from it.
